title: Comparing classification methods for predicting distance students' performance
abstract: Virtual teaching is constantly growing and, with it, the necessity of instructors
  to predict the performance of their students. In response to this necessity, different
  machine learning techniques can be used. Although there are so many benchmarks comparing
  their performance and accuracy, there are still very few experiments carried out
  on educational datasets which have very special features which make them different
  from other datasets. Therefore, in this work we compare the performance and interpretation
  level of the output of the different classification techniques applied on educational
  datasets and propose a meta-algorithm to preprocess the datasets and improve the
  accuracy of the model, which will be used by virtual instructors for their decision
  making through the ElWM tool.
