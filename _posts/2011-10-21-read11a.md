title: Streaming Multi-label Classification
abstract: This paper presents a new experimental framework for studying multi-label
  evolving stream classification, with efficient methods that combine the best practices
  in streaming scenarios with the best practices in multi-label classification. Many
  real world problems involve data which can be considered as multi-label data streams.
  Efficient methods exist for multi-label classification in non streaming scenarios.
  However, learning in evolving streaming scenarios is more challenging, as the learners
  must be able to adapt to change using limited time and memory. We present a new
  experimental software that extends the MOA framework. Massive Online Analysis (MOA)
  is a software environment for implementing algorithms and running experiments for
  online learning from evolving data streams. It is released under the GNU GPL license.
