title: Bayesian Probabilistic Models for Image Retrieval
abstract: In this paper we present new probabilistic ranking functions for content
  based image retrieval. Our methodology generalises previous approaches and is based
  on the predictive densities of generative probabilistic models modelling the density
  of image features. We evaluate the proposed methodology and compare it against two
  state of the art image retrieval systems using a well known image collection.
