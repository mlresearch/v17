title: Employing The Complete Face in AVSR to Recover from Facial Occlusions
abstract: Existing Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) systems visually focus intensely
  on a small region of the face, centred on the immediate mouth area. This is poor
  design for a variety reasons in real world situations because any occlusion to this
  small area renders all visual advantage null and void. This is poorby design because
  it is well known that humans use the complete face to speechread. We demonstrate
  a new application of a novel visual algorithm, the Multi-Channel Gradient Model,
  the deploys information from the complete face to perform AVSR. Our MCGM model performs
  near to the performance of Discrete Cosine Transforms in the case where a small
  region of interest around the lips, but in the case of an occluded face we can achieve
  results that match nearly 70\% of the performance that DCTs can achieve on the DCT
  best case, lips centeric approach.
