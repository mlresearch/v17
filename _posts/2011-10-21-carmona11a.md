title: Using GNUsmail to Compare Data Stream Mining Methods for On-line Email Classification
abstract: 'Real-time classification of emails is a challenging task because of its
  online nature, and also because email streams are subject to concept drift. Identifying
  email spam, where only two different labels or classes are defined (spam or not
  spam), has received great attention in the literature. We are nevertheless interested
  in a more specific classification where multiple folders exist, which is an additional
  source of complexity: the class can have a very large number of different values.
  Moreover, neither cross-validation nor other sampling procedures are suitable for
  evaluation in data stream contexts, which is why other metrics, like the prequential
  error, have been proposed. However, the prequential error poses some problems, which
  can be alleviated by using recently proposed mechanisms such as fading factors.
  In this paper, we present GNUsmail, an open-source extensible framework for email
  classification, and we focus on its ability to perform online evaluation. GNUsmails
  architecture supports incremental and online learning, and it can be used to compare
  different data stream mining methods, using state-of-art online evaluation metrics.
  Besides describing the framework, characterized by two overlapping phases, we show
  how it can be used to compare different algorithms in order to find the most appropriate
  one. The GNUsmail source code includes a tool for launching replicable experiments.'
