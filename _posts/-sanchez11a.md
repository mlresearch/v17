title: A Software System for the Microbial Source Tracking Problem
abstract: The aim of this paper is to report the achievement of Ichnaea, a fully computer-based
  prediction system that is able to make fairly accurate predictions for Microbial
  Source Tracking studies. The system accepts examples showing different concentration
  levels, uses indicators (variables) with different environmental persistence, and
  can be applied at different geographical or climatic areas. We describe the inner
  workings of the system and report on the specific problems and challenges arisen
  from the machine learning point of view and how they have been addressed.
