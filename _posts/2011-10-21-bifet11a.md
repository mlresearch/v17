title: Detecting Sentiment Change in Twitter Streaming Data
abstract: MOA-TweetReader is a real-time system to read tweets in real time, to detect
  changes, and to find the terms whose frequency changed. Twitter is a micro-blogging
  service built to discover what is happening at any moment in time, anywhere in the
  world. Twitter messages are short, and generated constantly, and well suited for
  knowledge discovery using data stream mining. MOA-TweetReader is a software extension
  to the MOA framework. Massive Online Analysis (MOA) is a software environment for
  implementing algorithms and running experiments for online learning from evolving
  data streams. MOA-TweetReader is released under the GNU GPL license.
