title: Automating Quantitative Narrative Analysis of News Data
abstract: 'We present a working system for large scale quantitative narrative analysis
  (QNA) of news corpora, which includes various recent ideas from text mining and
  pattern analysis in order to solve a problem arising in computational social sciences.
  The task is that of identifying the key actors in a body of news, and the actions
  they perform, so that further analysis can be carried out. This step is normally
  performed by hand and is very labour intensive. We then characterise the actors
  by: studying their position in the overall network of actors and actions; studying
  the time series associated with some of their properties; generating scatter plots
  describing the subject/object bias of each actor; and investigating the types of
  actions each actor is most associated with. The system is demonstrated on a set
  of 100,000 articles about crime appeared on the New York Times between 1987 and
  2007. As an example, we find that Men were most commonly responsible for crimes
  against the person, while Women and Children were most often victims of those crimes.'
